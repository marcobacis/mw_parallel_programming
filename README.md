# Middleware OpenMP Project: soccer ball possession computation

OpenMP project for the "Middleware Technologies for Distributed Systems" course at Polimi, consisting of an application to compute the real-time updated ball possession time for a soccer match.

## Abstract

The goal of the project is to develop a system to provide analytics over high velocity sensor data originating from a soccer game. The goal of the analysis is to report and update the ball possession time for each player and team periodically during the game. The data used comes from the DEBS2013 challenge, in which a number of wireless sensors embedded in the shoes and a ball were used during a soccer match, spanning the whole duration of the game The main requirements is to use OpenMP and/or MPI to compute the real-time statistics.
